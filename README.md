# Rubber-Ducky_RickRoll
Sneaky and brutal Rick Roll for Rubber Ducky. Works against Windows devices.
__Note that I don't have access to a ton of different Windows devices, so I'd recommend testing on your target platform before attempting to deploy this prank for real.__
## Why do I call this "sneaky and brutal"?
1. After deploying to the victim's machine, the script won't run until the next time the victim unlocks their machine or restarts it.
2. It will also periodically turn the victim machine's volume to maximum, so even when they mute their volume it will quickly return to max.
3. It gets installed as a service in Task Scheduler, so even if they manage to find a way to kill the script it will still run again the next time the machine reboots.
4. It only plays the music (no video) with no window open, so it's very difficult for the average user to figure out how to kill it.
